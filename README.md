# Job Posting Requirements/Guidelines

- **Only** long-term contracts (> 6 months)
- **Only** full-time
- **Only** fully remote jobs - 1 day required in the office is not remote!
- Close the issue when the position is filled
- A good description helps both job seekers and your screening process
- Every job post is closed in 30 days, but you can re-open or re-post

# Job Aggregation Algorithm

We currently feed this job board from remoteok.io and weworkremotely.com

A nightly job synchronizes job listings from these sites:

- new jobs will appear first in the issues list
- removed jobs will have the correspoding issue closed

We map relevant tags/keywords to labels to make filtering easier.
